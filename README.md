## Network & security training
- Completed hands-on school training with **Wireshark** and **BackTrack** (instructor-led labs).
- Skills: packet capture (pcap), display filters, TCP/UDP analysis, HTTP/SSL inspection, basic network forensics, and lab-based penetration testing workflows.
- This repo contains lab writeups and anonymized sample PCAPs demonstrating analysis steps.

## Repositories
- `wireshark-labs/` â€” lab exercises, screenshots, anonymized PCAPs, and step-by-step analysis.
- `network-tools/` â€” useful commands and scripts (tcpdump, tshark, basic Scapy examples).
